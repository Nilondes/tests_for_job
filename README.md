Two tests to figure out whether the group algorithm is good. (spoiler: it's not :( )

The alogrithm defines the group for user by summing digits of user_id. 
These two functions show how many users are there in each group. 
The first one starts with user_id = 0, the starting user_id of the second one could be set.

Tests show that this algorithm distributes users not uniformly...
